### Synced
Synced is a fullstack web application built with Ruby on Rails and ReactJS. The purpose of this app is to synchronize music so users can listen to songs at the same time regardless of their location. It is my final project as part of Flatiron School's Software Engineering Bootcamp.

### Motivation
I built Synced because I always imagined a world where people can experience music together and not be bound by spatial constraints. With Synced, people in the same room working, having lunch, or doing any other activity can listen together through their own devices, but furthermore, people across the world can listen to albums together, or a person can throw a multi-location party from one spot.

### Tech / Frameworks

#### Built with
- Ruby on Rails
- ReactJS
- Redux
- Websockets with Rails' ActionCable
- srpotify: https://github.com/guilhermesad/rspotify

### Features

- Users can look up songs seeded in the database, select and play it. 
- Users can create / delete playlists.
- Users can add / remove songs from a playlist.

- Users can see who is online.
- Users can broadcast a station.
- Users can see online stations' activity (artist, song name and album).
- Users can join a station and be synced to it.
- There is no limit on how many people can join a station, but more than four users slows down your machine!

### Installation
- Clone this repository and the backend found here: https://github.com/camfeghali/synced-backend
- In backend directory: 
  - Run `rails db:migrate`
  - Run `rails db:seed`

### Bugs and missing features
#### Bugs
- Crashes when users create account with already existing username.

##### Bug fixes:
- Must create new dispatch action to handle invalid user creation or login from backend response.
#### Missing features
- Users should be able to add favorites, and see their activity.
- Users should be able to join favorite's stations whether they be hosts or tuned into one.
- Users should be able to continuously play music after clicking on a playlist's song and not have to load a song everytime.
- Implement the full Spotify API and not use the 30 seconds preview urls but complete tracks.
